# Data Manipulation in JavaScript

This directory provides an overview of data manipulation in JavaScript using Arrays, Sets, Map, and WeakMap.

## Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in JavaScript that allow you to store and manipulate collections of elements. They provide various methods for adding, removing, and modifying elements. Some common array manipulation methods include:

- `push()`: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
- `pop()`: Removes the last element from an array.
- `splice()`: Adds or removes elements from an array at a specified index.
- `map()`: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
- `filter()`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function.

## Sets

Sets are a built-in data structure in JavaScript that allow you to store unique values of any type. They provide methods for adding, removing, and checking the presence of elements. Some common set manipulation methods include:

- `add()`: Adds an element to a set.
- `delete()`: Removes an element from a set.
- `has()`: Checks if an element is present in a set.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in a set.

## Map

Maps are another built-in data structure in JavaScript that allow you to store key-value pairs. They provide methods for adding, removing, and retrieving values based on keys. Some common map manipulation methods include:

- `set()`: Adds a key-value pair to a map.
- `get()`: Retrieves the value associated with a key in a map.
- `delete()`: Removes a key-value pair from a map.
- `has()`: Checks if a key is present in a map.
- `size()`: Returns the number of key-value pairs in a map.

## WeakMap

WeakMaps are similar to Maps, but with a few key differences. They only accept objects as keys, and the keys are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage collected if there are no other references to them. WeakMaps provide methods for adding, removing, and retrieving values based on keys. Some common WeakMap manipulation methods include:

- `set()`: Adds a key-value pair to a WeakMap.
- `get()`: Retrieves the value associated with a key in a WeakMap.
- `delete()`: Removes a key-value pair from a WeakMap.
- `has()`: Checks if a key is present in a WeakMap.

This is just a brief overview of data manipulation using Arrays, Sets, Map, and WeakMap in JavaScript. For more detailed information, refer to the official JavaScript documentation.
